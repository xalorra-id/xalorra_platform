          Xalorra Foundation oversees the open ecosystem and stewarding of IP and trademark. Meanwhile, Xalorra Inc. manages paid offerings, enterprise support, and infrastructure hosting.

          Monetization is aligned with usage â€” not ownership. We provide:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Free tier for indie devs and open science use</li>
          <li>Paid team plans with CI/CD, usage-based training, and hosted vector DB</li>
          <li>On-premise enterprise licensing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We believe open tools thrive when they are both usable and valuable. Our dual structure enables this balance.
